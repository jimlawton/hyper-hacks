Here are my macOS Sierra hacks using some combination of Karabiner-Elements and Hammerspoon

== Background:

http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/[Hyper key hack]

== Installation:

* Install link:http://www.hammerspoon.org[Hammerspoon]
* Install link:https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements[Karabiner-Elements]
* Put `hammerspoon/init.lua` in `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`
* Put `karabinier/karabiner.json` in `~/.config/karabinier/karabiner.json`

That's pretty much it.

s is still fairly simplistic, but it works for me right now.

Check out the link:https://github.com/lodestone/hyper-hacks/wiki[Wiki] for ideas on how to configure your `init.lua`.
